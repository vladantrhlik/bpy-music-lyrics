Motion blurred dream visions and kindred faces
Thoughts like bursts of youth taking me places
Living the best outcome of myself
'Cause I do remember where I come from

I'm happy my home found me
By which force I do not know
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty

I feel air from another planet akin
Like a sense of truth that comes from within
A budding sapling reaching through
Giving rise to higher fruit and view

I'm happy my home found me
By which force I do not know
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty

I'm happy my home found me
By which force I do not know
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty
